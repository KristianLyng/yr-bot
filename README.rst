yr-bot
======

A simple IRC bot in AWK that also parses yr.no xml

gawk-the-bot.awk is the main executable.
master.sh is a silly wrapper to GET | ./yr.awk
yr.awk parses XML data and returns a formatted string

Nothing fancy, nothing sane, nothing pretty.

Documentation was 50% of the effort for this project.
